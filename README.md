I'm currently learning full stack web development going through the complete Learn Enough course. After a couple of failed attempts learning coding in a structured manner, I'm at it again. The goal is to keep building the builder's muscle. Like any other muscle, it does atrophy when not used properly.

To me coding is freedom. I would like to get to a point where I can build and make things fast using code.
