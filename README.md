After a couple of failed attempts learning coding in a structured manner, I'm at it again. For 2024, I've taken a resolution to learn (and apply) <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> more rigorouslyâ€”-a fantastic framework for building modern web applications.

These badges show that I have completed the online courses for <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/shreyas314159/command-line-tutorial">Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous </a>, <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/shreyas314159/text-editor-tutorial">Learn Enough Text Editor to Be Dangerous</a> and <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/certificates/shreyas314159/git-tutorial">Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous</a>. I'm inching my way to learn HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript and then *finally*, Ruby on Rails!

With RoR, I would (hopefully) get to a point where I could build and ship prototypes/apps fast. For more info on my work as a software artist, please explore my <a href="https://www.shreyasprakash.com">personal website</a>.
